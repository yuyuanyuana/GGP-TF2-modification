# GGP-TF2-modification

GGP is a semi-supervised learning with graph gussian processes. The paper （ Bayesian Semi-supervised Learning with Graph Gaussian Processes ）can be find [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04379).

We just made a small modification to the code [GGP-TF2](https://github.com/FelixOpolka/GGP-TF2) which is based on GPflow 2 and TensorFlow 2.2.

The original implementation accompanying the paper: [GGP-raw](https://github.com/yincheng/GGP)
